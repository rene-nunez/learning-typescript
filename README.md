# Learning TypeScript

This repository documents my journey learning TypeScript, from fundamental concepts to more advanced usage. It contains notes, exercises, and small projects focused on understanding TypeScript through practice.

I will keep updating this repository as I continue learning. If this is useful for others learning TypeScript, feel free to explore it.
